***********************************************************************
*  RP_SInit:  extention to SysInit.
*
*  This is the routine that is called from SysInit.  The CPU performs
*  very little before it reaches this routine.  We will set up the 
*  chip selects so that we have access to the modules, ROM and RAM.
*
RP_SInit:
 
 rts return to SysInit.

*****************************************************************************
*  RP_SInit2:  extention to SInitTwo.
*
*  This is the routine that is called from SInitTwo.  The CPU has constructed
*  the RAM vectors ( if included ) and the exception jump tables.  This would
*  be a place to install handlers for boards that generate unsolicited
*  interrupts that would cause the system to fail it's boot proceedure.
*
RP_SInit2:
 movem.l d0-d1/a0,-(sp)

*
*  Set operational level for the CD2401 serial chip
*
 movea.l #TermBase+GFRCR,a0 Base address of the 2401 chip
