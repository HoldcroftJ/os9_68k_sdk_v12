* 02 93/07/28  VMEChip setup moved to sysinit for new NVRAM and ats
*              backplane booter support. Adapted MWOS directory
*              structure. Fixed CD2401 setup on 33Mhz board.
*    97/05/13  ****** version 3.0.3 release ******************* gdw
* 03 99/07/30  Correct cd2401Wait to watch GFRCR                srm
* 04 99/08/31  Add timeout to cd2401Wait and flash LED if wait  srm

*  RP_SInit:  extention to SysInit.
*
*  This is the routine that is called from SysInit.  The CPU performs
*  very little before it reaches this routine.  We will set up the 
*  chip selects so that we have access to the modules, ROM and RAM.

*****************************************************************************
*  RP_SInit2:  extention to SInitTwo.
*
*  This is the routine that is called from SInitTwo.  The CPU has constructed
*  the RAM vectors ( if included ) and the exception jump tables.  This would
*  be a place to install handlers for boards that generate unsolicited
*  interrupts that would cause the system to fail it's boot proceedure.
