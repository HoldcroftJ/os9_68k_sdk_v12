					uMACS 1.0 Help Screen

	M-  means to use the <ESC> key prior to using another key
	^A  means to use the control key at the same time as the A key

^V     Scroll down		M-<		Begining of file
^Z     Scroll up		M->		End of file

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		(1) MOVING THE CURSOR

^F  Forward character   M-F    Forward word
^B  Backward character  M-B    Backward word
^A  Front of line		^E  End of line		
^N  Next line			^P  Previous line
M-P    Front of paragraph	M-N    End of paragraph
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		(2) SEARCHING

M-S	Search forward from cursor position.  Type in a string to be searched
	for at the prompt and end it with ESC.  Either case matches either
	unless EXACT mode is set for the current buffer
M-R	As above, but Reverse search from cursor position.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		(3) REPLACING

^R   Replace all instances of first typed-in string with second
          typed-in string.  End each string with ESC.
M-^R  Replace with query.  Answer with:
	^G  cancel			.   exit to entry point
	!   replace the rest		Y    replace & continue
	?   Get a list of options	N   no replacement & continue
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		(4) CAPITALIZING & TRANSPOSING

M-U	UPPERCASE word
M-C	Capitalize word		^T	Transpose characters
M-L	lowercase word
^X^L	lowercase region
^X^U	uppercase region
M-Q	Quote next entry, so that control codes may be entered into text
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		(5) REGIONS & THE KILL BUFFER

M-<spacebar>	set MARK at current position
^X^X		eXchange mark and cursor

A REGION will then be continuously-defined as the area between the mark and
the current cursor position.  The KILL BUFFER is the text which has been
most recently saved or deleted.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		(6) DELETING & INSERTING

<--	Delete previous character	M-<--	Delete previous word
^D	Delete next character		M-D	Delete next word
^K	Close (delete) to end of line
^O	Open (insert) line
^W	Delete region between mark (set using M-<spacebar>) and cursor
M-W	Copy region to kill buffer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		(7) COPYING AND MOVING

^W  Delete (Wipe) region		M-W	copy region to KILL buffer
^Y  Yankback save buffer at cursor
Generally, the procedure for copying or moving text is:
    1)  Mark a REGION using M-<spacebar> at beginning and cursor at end.
    2)  Delete it (with ^W) or copy it (with M-W) into the KILL buffer.
    3)  Move the cursor to the desired location and yank it back (with ^Y).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		(8) MODES OF OPERATION
^X M	Add Mode		^X ^M	Delete Mode
	OVER	Replaces (overwrites) rather than inserts characters
	WRAP	Turns on word wrap (automatic carraige return).
	VIEW	Allows viewing file without insertion and deletion.
	EXACT	All searches done with exact case matching
	CMODE	Automatic indenting for C program entry
		(automatically set on any files ending with .C or .H)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		(9) ON-SCREEN FORMATTING

^X F		Set fill column
M-O			Format paragraph so that text lies between margins
^X =		Position report -- displays line number, char count, size


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		(10) MULTIPLE WINDOWS

Many WINDOWS may be active at once on the screen.  All windows may show
different parts of the same buffer, or each may display a different one.

^X 2	Split the current window in two	^X 1	remove all but current window
^X O	cursor to next window		^XZ		Enlarge current window
M-^V	scroll down, other window	M-^Z	scroll up, other window
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		(11) MULTIPLE BUFFERS
A BUFFER is a named area containing a document being edited.  Many buffers
may be activated at once.
^X B	Switch to another buffer.  <CR> = use just-previous buffer
^X ^B	Type buffer directory in a window
^X ^F	Find file; read into a new buffer created from filename.
^X K	Delete a non-displayed buffer.
^X X	Switch to next buffer in buffer list
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		(12) READING FROM DISK

^X^F	Find file; read into a new buffer created from filename.
	(This is the usual way to begin editing a new file.)
^X^R	Read file into current buffer, erasing its previous contents.
	No new buffer will be created.
^X^I	Insert file into current buffer at cursor's location.
^X^V	Find a file to make current in VIEW mode
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		(13) SAVING TO DISK

^XS	Save current buffer to disk, using the buffer's filename
	as the name of the disk file.  Any disk file of that name
	will be overwritten.
^X^W	Write current buffer to disk.  Type in a new filename at the
	prompt to write to; it will become the current buffer's filename.
M-Z	Write out all changed buffers and exit uMACS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		(14) ACCESSING THE OPERATING SYSTEM

^X!	Send one command to the operating system and return
^XC	Start a new command processer under uMACS
^X^C	Exit uMACS
M-Z	Write out all changed buffers and then exit uMACS

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		(15) SPECIAL KEYS AND KEY BINDINGS

^G		Cancel current command and return to top level of processing.
^U or		Universal repeat.  May be followed by an integer (default = 4)
M-<digit>	and repeats the next command that many times.
M-X		Execute a named (and possibly unbound) command
M-K		Bind a key to a named command
Describe-Bindings
		List the current key bindings in a buffer
