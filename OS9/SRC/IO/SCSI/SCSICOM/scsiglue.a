* --- --------  ---  ---------------------------------------
*  1  88/01/14  djl  created
*  2  88/08/03  srw  reworked for wd33c93
*  3  88/08/05  wwb  name changing exercise:  high-level drvr is "rb5400",
*                    low-level is "scsi33c93".
*  4  88/08/16  lac  revisions to syscalls.a to reduce stack usage.
*  5  88/09/01  lac  Revised to use SCSI controller interrupts instead of
*                    DMA interrupts to signal IRQ event.  Added a flag for
*                    the high-level driver to tell the low-level driver
*                    which direction to transfer data.
*  6  88/09/02  lac  Revised static storage usage; now requires the
*                    high-level driver to supply the RBF static storage
*                    ptr in a6.
*  7  90/04/18  wwb  added a5 initialization for stack traceback in
*                    debuggers.
*                    ---- OS-9/68K V2.4 released ----
*  8  93/06/08  ats  Extracted irqsvc into separate .a file for inclusion
*                    into rb327 for Ultrafication.
*  9  93/07/02  wwb  converted for UCC.
*               ---- OS-9/68K V3.0 released ----

Edition set 9 low-level module should change this via @_sysedit:

 use defsfile

Typ_Lang set (Sbrtn<<8)+Objct a subroutine module
Attr_Rev set ((ReEnt+SupStat)<<8)+0 attributes and revision

 psect scsiglue,Typ_Lang,Attr_Rev,Edition,0,Entry


* set "init" entry as module entry point

Entry bra init call the init function


* RBF static definition
*
* this definition resolves references in the C portion of the low-level driver
* without actually declaring storage.  This requires that the high-level driver
* pass the static storage ptr in a6.

rbfstat: equ 0

 use ./irqsvc.a

 ends
