*		stoirq - Select Timeout IRQ Service entry
*
* Synopsis:  Kernel calls with the following:
*             (a2) = static storage ptr
*             (a3) = port address
*             (a6) = system global data ptr
*
*    Returns:  (cc) = carry clear (interrupt serviced)
*
*    Error Return:  (cc) = carry set (interrupt NOT serviced)
*		
*    NOTE:  The following registers may be destroyed by the
*           IRQ service routine:  d0, d1, a0, a2, a3, a6.
*           Any other registers used MUST be preserved.

stoirq: move.l a5,-(sp) save a5
 move.l a2,d0 copy low-level static storage ptr
 move.l a3,d1 copy port address
 suba.l a5,a5 set top of stack (traceback)
 bsr seltoirq call irq service
 move.l d0,d1 was interrupt serviced ?
 beq.s irq_done ..yes; return carry clear
 ori.w #Carry,ccr flag interrupt NOT serviced
irq_done movea.l (sp)+,a5 restore a5 (keep ccr status)
