
novme050:
* we get here via a BUS ERROR.  As the Exception Jump Table was
* used to get here, the bus-error stack frame is located at 4(sp),
* due to the "pushing" of the exception address on the stack by
* the code in the Exception Jump Table.
*
* Note that in this case we don't care about preserving the 
* Supervisor State flag, nor the MSP flag, as this code is always
* supervisor state, and the MSP is currently unused.
*
 move.w 4(sp),sr recover pre-exception SR (mainly for Trace Flags)
*
* realize also that you cannot put a 'rom' breakpoint at the above
* label (chicken/egg syndrome).  This next label is the appropriate
* place for a breakpoint to be set when setting breakpoints in rom.
