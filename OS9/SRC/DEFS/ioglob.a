* System Dependent I/O global static storage definitions

*   This is a 256 byte common global area which can be used
* by system dependent hardware drivers.  The biggest need
* for them occurs when a single, write only register is used
* by more than one device in the system.  They should be
* used sparingly.  References to this area are usually like:
* "move.b D_DMAReq(a6),d0".
