*  RP_SInit:  extention to SysInit.
*
*  This is the routine that is called from SysInit.  The CPU performs
*  very little before it reaches this routine. 
*
RP_SInit:
 rts return to SysInit.

*****************************************************************************
*  RP_SInit2:  extention to SInitTwo.
*
*  This is the routine that is called from SInitTwo.  The CPU has constructed
*  the RAM vectors ( if included ) and the exception jump tables.  This would
*  be a place to install handlers for boards that generate unsolicited
*  interrupts that would cause the system to fail it's boot proceedure.
*
*   At this time, if the internal registers of the mc68360 have been 
*      remapped, the remapped addresses are in effect.  Must use the
*      cccMap version of the registers from here on.
*
RP_SInit2:
 rts return to SInitTwo.
