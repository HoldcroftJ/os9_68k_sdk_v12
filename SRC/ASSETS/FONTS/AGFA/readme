The directories MT and TT hold the font files that are the basis for the font data modules 
in the mwos\OS9000\<processor port>ASSETS\FONTS\AGFA directory. The makefile in this 
directory (mwos\SRC\ASSETS\AGFA) calls the makefiles in the MT and TT directories. The 
makefiles in these directories will wrap their respective font files into data modules 
and place them into the following directories:

mwos\OS9000\<processor port>ASSETS\FONTS\AGFA\MT
and
mwos\OS9000\<processor port>ASSETS\FONTS\AGFA\TT


Use os9make in this directory to build the data modules from the fonts in both the TT and 
MT directories. 

Use os9make in the MT directory to make data modules from the fonts in that directory.

Use os9make in the TT directory to make data modules from the fonts in that directory.
