MAUI winmgr/winmgrdemo demo code
**********************************************************************
What this demo does:
  - This is an example of a manager for windowing programs.
  - Run this in the background before running winink or windraw.
  - Note: To resolve a module name conflict the module has been
    renamed to winmgrdemo, but the filename is still winmgr so the
    bootlists would still work.

**********************************************************************
System requirements:
  - A working MAUI environment is assumed.
  - The demo requires that maui_win is in memory or is in the execution
	directory.
  - The demo requires that gfx is in memory.
  - The demo requires that mfm is in memory.

  - The process 'maui_inp' must be running in the background. To
    verify that it is running use the os9000 command 'procs'. If it 
	is not present run it before starting the demo. e.g.

      $ maui_inp <>>>/nil &

	background.

      $ winmgrdemo <>>>/nil &

  - Note: on some platforms the priorities of 'maui_inp' and
    'winmgrdemo' need to be higher than the default (128). Set 
    the priority using the '^' character. e.g.

      $ maui_inp ^255 <>>>/nil &
      $ winmgrdemo ^201 <>>>/nil &
