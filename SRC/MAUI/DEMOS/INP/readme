MAUI Input Device API demo code
**********************************************************************
What this demo does:
  - The demo looks in the CDB for the first device of type 
    CDB_TYPE_REMOTE.
      1. If a pointer input device is found:
        a. Messages will be displayed to standard error when the cursor
           position is changed or buttons are selected.
        b. To terminate the program, select both buttons simultaneously
           or press control-c on the console (where you started inp) to
           send a signal 3 to the application.

      2. If a key input device is found:
        a. Messages will be displayed to standard error for each key 
           selected.
        b. To terminate the program, press control-c on the console
           (where you started inp) to send a signal 3 to the
           application.

**********************************************************************
System requirements:
  - A working MAUI environment is assumed.
  - The demo requires that maui_inp is in memory and running.
 
**********************************************************************
Directories: 
  - Source code 
      $MWOS/SRC/MAUI/DEMOS/INP
        
**********************************************************************
To make this demo:
  - From the source file directory type:
      % os9make
 
**********************************************************************
Operation:
  - The process 'maui_inp' must be running in the background. To
    verify that it is use the os9000 command 'procs'. If it is not
    present run it before starting the demo. e.g.

      $ maui_inp <>>>/nil &
 
  - This demo can run with no command line options. To run simply
    type the demo name. The shell prompt will return after the demo
    ends.

      $ inp

    This will search for the first input device in the CDB.

  - This demo can also explicitly name an input device. For instance:

      $ inp -i=/t1/mp_msptr

    This attempts to read a serial mouse connected to serial port /t1.
