jview - MAUI based JPEG viewer
**********************************************************************

This application (along with its JPEG library) has several problems,
(possible memory leak, obtuse command line interface, etc. This
application and the JPEG libraries was user contributed but has not
subjected to a Microware code review. It is being distributed with the
standard product due to the high demand for a JPEG viewer. We hope you
find this code useful in spite of any flaws. 

**********************************************************************
What this example does:
  - This program uses the MAUI JPEG API to display either single or
    sequential JPEG images.
   
  - If the program is used in a single-image mode, its format is as follows:
   
     % jview <file_name> <options>
   
    where <file_name> is the JPEG image file in the current directory or
    in the module directory.
   
  - If a slide-show mode is used, the format is:
   
     % jview <list_file> S <options>
   
    where <list_file> is the file in the current directory, that holds
                      the list of JPEG image files, one name per line.
   
        For example:
   
        earth.jpg
        edo.jpg
        ......
   
  - JPEG files must be in the current directory or in the module directory.
   
   
  - Options:
   
     q<value> - quality level, 1 through 3 (default is 3 - the highest);
     s<nd>    - scale, n - numerator, d - denominator (1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8
                are supported); for example, s12 means scale 1:2.
     m - monochrome;
     c<value> - number of colors (default is 256);
     C<value> - color method number in dev_cap (default is 0);
     r - resolution number in dev_cap (default is 0);
     S - slide mode; this assumes that list file is used;
     T<value> - time to display each slide in sec (default is 3);
     F - use fade-in and fade-out effect(default - no fade);
         Note that fade effect is only available in CLUT-based coding methods.
     V - verbose mode (debug);
