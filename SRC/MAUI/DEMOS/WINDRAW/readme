MAUI windraw demo code
**********************************************************************
What this demo does:
  - This is an example of a windowing program.
  - This program is simular to fdraw except it uses the WIN API to
    draw blocks in a window.

**********************************************************************
System requirements:
  - A working MAUI environment is assumed.
  - The demo requires that maui_win is in memory or is in the execution
	directory.
  - The demo requires that maui_inp is running.
  - The demo requires that winmgrdemo is running. 
    Note: To resolve a module name conflict the module has been
    renamed to winmgrdemo, but the filename is still winmgr so the
    bootlists would still work.
  - The demo requires that gfx is in memory.
  - The demo requires that mfm is in memory.

*********************************************************************
To make this demo:
  - From the source file directory type:
      % os9make

*********************************************************************
Operation:
  - To list the usage information for this demo type the demo name.

  - The process' 'maui_inp' and 'winmgrdemo' must be running in the 
    background.  To verify that they are use the os9000 command 
    'procs'. If they are not present run it before starting the 
    demo. e.g.

      $ maui_inp <>>>/nil &

  - Run 'winmgrdemo' in the background.

      $ winmgrdemo <>>>/nil &

  - Note: on some platforms the priorities of 'maui_inp' and
    'winmgrdemo' need to be higher than the default (128). Set the
    priority using the '^' character. e.g.

      $ maui_inp ^255 <>>>/nil &
      $ winmgrdemo ^201 <>>>/nil &
