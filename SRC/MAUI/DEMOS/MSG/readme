MAUI message API demo code
**********************************************************************
What this demo does:

  -  This demo shows the use of the message functions using a mailbox.  
     When the write process 'msgwrtr' is executed the process 
	 creates a mailbox, then initiates the read process 'msgrdr'.
	 The two processes then pass messages to each other through the
	 mailbox.  

  -  When executed, this demo does the following:
     1.  The message write process will write 1001 messages in the mailbox.
     2.  While the write process is writing, the read process will read 
         messages from the mailbox.  If the mailbox becomes full a
		 diagnostic will be printed and go on.
     3.  When the read process receives a message of type MSG_DONE, it 
         will display the number of messages read. This should 
		 indicate 1001 messages read.  
     4.  Both the read and write processes then terminate.


  -  This demo is capable of showing the use of a filter routine attached
     to a mailbox.  To enable the use of the filter routine simply
     define the FILTER environment variable.  The filter will simply 
     print out the message "filter!" and accept the message.  To enable 
     the installation of the filter do the following before running msgwrtr:
     $ setenv FILTER x
