#
#	OS-9 NFS server to remote system gid/uid mapping
#
#	If the -d option is not given to rpcdbgen, no gid/uid mapping is
#	performed.  The requests made to NFS server will be executed with the
#	priviledges of the user making the I/O request. In order to allow different
#	priviledge levels for different users you must make a uid map file similar
#	to the one shown below. The entry "g12  10" states that when
#   fulfilling requests from a user with a remote group id of 12, NFS server
#   should set its effective group id to 10. The entries starting with a "u" 
#   are used to specify user id mappings. If a request is encountered with a 
#   g/uid that has no mapping NFS will use the g/uid of the caller.  A default 
#   can be specified by using either a "g" or "u" followed by a "*" and then 
#   give the group number or user number. Any requests that come in and have
#   no mapping of their own will use these default mappings.
